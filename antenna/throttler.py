    The throttler can throttle incoming crashes using the content of the crash.
    To throttle, you set up a rule set which is a list of ``Rule`` instances.
    That goes in a Python module which is loaded at run time.

    If you don't want to throttle anything, use this::

        THROTTLE_RULES=antenna.throttler.accept_all


    To set up a rule set, put it in a Python file and define the rule set
    there. For example, you could have file ``myruleset.py`` with this in it::

        from antenna.throttler import Rule

        rules = [
            Rule('ProductName', 'Firefox', 100),
            # ...
        ]

    then set ``THROTTLE_RULES`` to the path for that. For example, depending
    on the current working directory and ``PYTHONPATH``, the above could be::

        THROTTLE_RULES=myruleset.rules


    FIXME(willkg): Flesh this out.
